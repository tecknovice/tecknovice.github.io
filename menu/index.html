                    the restaurant is surrounded by history. 
                    Cau Go Street, from which the restaurant takes its name, is one of the original 36 streets of the Hanoi old quarter and trading center. 
                    The street is still home to a number of ancient buildings as well as a vibrant food scene. Hanoian families are justifiably proud of their
                    beautiful city and rich culture. Hanoi is the political and cultural hub of Vietnam and the most elegant capital city in all of Asia. Cuisine here
                    is a way of life, with a pulsating food scene that is constanly evolving where traditional recipes experience contemporary movements. 
                    Cau Go Restaurant does not just bring you the very best of Hanoi cuisine, but draws upon flavors from across the nation to devise a menu
                    that combines the best of all the regions in Vietnam.
